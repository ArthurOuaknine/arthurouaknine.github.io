About Me
======

I’m have a Ph.D. from Télécom Paris ([IDS department](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal), [IMAGES Team](https://images.telecom-paristech.fr/)) and [valeo.ai](https://www.valeo.com/en/valeo-ai/), under the supervision of [Patrick Pérez](https://ptrckprz.github.io/), [Florence Tupin](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/) and [Alasdair Newson](https://sites.google.com/site/alasdairnewson/). The aim of my Ph.D. work was to use and adapt deep neural network architectures for scene understanding using automotive radar data and multi-sensor fusion.
I graduated from M.Sc. Machine Learning and Big Data at [Télécom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/) in 2018, M.Sc. (1 and 2) in Statistical Modelling at [Paris Panthéon Sorbonne University](https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/) in 2016 and B.S. in Applied Mathematics at [Paris Diderot University](https://formations.univ-paris-diderot.fr/fr/index.html) in 2014.

During my Ph.D., I co-organized the Deep Learning Working Group of the IMAGES Team (Télécom Paris). Presentations are available [here](https://dlwgtelecomparis.github.io/).

**Announcement**: I am currently looking for a post-doc or a ML research position on deep learning methods applied to climate change mitigation (forest management, deforestation detection, wildfire detection, greenhouse gas emission estimation).
