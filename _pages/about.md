About Me
======

<div style="text-align: justify">
I am a postdoctoral researcher fellow at  <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a> and <a href="https://mila.quebec/" target="_blank">Mila</a> (Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute), in collaboration with <a href="https://davidrolnick.com/" target="_blank">David Rolnick</a>. My research projects are focused on multi-modal and multi-task deep learning for remote sensing applied to forest monitoring. I am co-founder and chief technical officer (CTO) of <a href="https://rubisco.ai/" target="_blank">Rubisco AI</a>, a Mila startup that aims to monitor forest restoration projects. I am also a core team member of <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/" target="_blank">Climate Change AI</a> where I lead the webinar team and I co-lead the organization of the CCAI workshop at <a href="https://www.climatechange.ai/events/iclr2024" target="_blank">ICLR 2024</a>.

<div style="text-align: justify">
I completed my Ph.D. in March 2022 in collaboration between <a href="https://www.ip-paris.fr/en" target="_blank">Institut Polytechnique de Paris</a> (<a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en" target="_blank">Télécom Paris</a>; <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/the-school/teaching-research-departments/image-data-signal" target="_blank">IDS department</a>, <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en/research/labs/information-processing-ltci/teams/image-modeling-analysis-geometry-synthesis/staff" target="_blank">IMAGES Team</a>)) and <a href="https://www.valeo.com/en/valeo-ai/" target="_blank">valeo.ai</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://ptrckprz.github.io/" target="_blank">Patrick Pérez</a>, <a href="https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/" target="_blank">Florence Tupin</a> and  <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/alasdairnewson/" target="_blank">Alasdair Newson</a>. The aim of my Ph.D. work was to use and adapt deep neural network architectures for scene understanding using automotive radar data and multi-sensor fusion.

<div style="text-align: justify">
I graduated from M.Sc. Machine Learning and Big Data at <a href="https://www.telecom-paris.fr/en" target="_blank">Télécom Paris</a> in 2018, M.Sc. (1 and 2) in Statistical Modelling at <a href="https://www.pantheonsorbonne.fr/" target="_blank">Paris Panthéon Sorbonne University</a> in 2016 and B.S. in Applied Mathematics at <a href="https://u-paris.fr/" target="_blank">Paris Diderot University</a> in 2014.
</div>
<div style="text-align: justify">
During my Ph.D., I co-organized the Deep Learning Working Group of the IMAGES Team (Télécom Paris). Presentations are available <a href="https://dlwgtelecomparis.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>.
